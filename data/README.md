Run the create_user_data.py or create_user_data.ipynb to create user data chain. The process might takes 14 hours straight. 

However, we recommend to split the dataset into chunks. My attempt was 100,000 rows each, You will get about 350 files.

If you split dataset, run combine_user_data.ipynb then. Otherwise, this file is unnecessary
